# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## A Webpage outlining the knowlage and resources we've learned about so far

    The motivation behind this project was to showcase the knowlage and abilities we gained through doing the prework and putting it on a webpage to refrence in the future, now anytime we have questions or have notes we want to write down we have a place to do so and also practice the coding knowlage we've gained, it was a great way to learn how there can be a lot of complexities in something as simple as a Study Guide Webpage, I learned a lot about the coding process and the very basics of how HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript work and am looking forward to learning more!
